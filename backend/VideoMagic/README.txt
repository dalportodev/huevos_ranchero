HOW TO RUN VideoMagic:

Click this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/rbbm5sa5py6nqts/VideoMagic.zip?dl=0

After downloading, unzip the folder. Inside, there should be a program called 'vm', a folder called 'external', and another folder called 'videos'. Don't touch the external folder. The videos folder is where you would (obviously) store the videos. I have provided 2 sample videos for testing purposes, but feel free to remove those. To run the program, follow this format:

./vm {video id} {extract/combine}

Make sure you have your postgres server up and running, and that it is set up according to our agreed upon settings.

Let me know if you find any problems or have questions! :)
